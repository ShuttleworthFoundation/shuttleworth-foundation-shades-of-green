# Appendix

## Overview

The following are practical instruments used in the fellowship. These are all living documents that represent the embodiment of our theories, changing as new ideas come into the fellowship. These are published using open licenses. Please them and use them for your own purposes.

Updates and further documentation can be found at:

## i. Application form

Every potential fellow fills out an application form. Each question is designed to help everyone understand the essence of what, why and how a change will manifest.

Prospective applicants often ask us to narrow down the parameters for applications and be more specific about what we’re looking for. We are not planning on doing that, as we want to be surprised and intrigued by applicants, no matter how unconventional the idea may be.

Deliberately, the form uses clean, simple questions that carve a narrative and act as a basis for conversation and partnership.

## ii. The agreement letter

The agreement letter is what fellows receive just after we let them know they have been selected. As far as possible, the letter uses clean, straightforward language, and sets out the commitments and values upon which the fellowship will be based.

Dear New Fellow,

This agreement sets out how we will work together over the coming year. Once you’re happy with this document, please confirm you wish to proceed, and we will load it into our digital signature management system for signing. At that point, it will become effective as our mutual agreement.

Included in this agreement is a specification sheet, which details the data pertaining to your specific Fellowship, a fellowship overview, which describes what we hope to achieve together, and our broad philosophy and theory of change, which outlines how we behave in the world. Also included are the governing provisions which will protect both of us going forward.

Our commitment to you This Fellowship offers you freedom, financial ability, and an enabling support structure to bring about the change you envisage for the world. We will provide technological, accounting, and legal support. We aim to be a true collaborator in working and thinking with you to achieve your goals. You will find yourself part of an ever growing community of trust, where wins, losses, learnings and experiences are shared.

Your commitment to us You will wholeheartedly commit to driving the change you envision in the world. That includes making the most of the opportunities this Fellowship offers.

To do that, you agree not to do paid or time-consuming work outside of the Fellowship without our explicit, case-by-case permission. We’re likely to approve other work if we’re confident it won’t negatively affect your ability to implement your vision to change the world.

You will actively participate in the safe spaces we have created to connect, share, commiserate, learn and celebrate, both in person and online. We believe the whole of this community really is stronger than its constituent parts. Whilst domains may not overlap, the sentiment and overarching ideals do. Mutual respect and care are at the heart of it.

You will actively and publicly identify yourself as a Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow, strengthening the collective voice of the group in its pursuit of openness, inclusiveness and equity. Please use the appropriate Foundation logos to do so.

You will keep confidential any information about the Foundation and your fellow Fellows that might reasonably need to be kept confidential. The personal security and liberty of some Fellows could be at risk if video or photographic images of them are made public. When in doubt, ask.

Openness Being open with our work is vital for others to replicate it and benefit society. If we can shorten the time it takes a good idea to spread by living out loud, the results will speak for themselves. Everything we work on is designed to demonstrate the power of openness, participation and creativity. We believe your work can help build an open knowledge society. That is why we insist on open communications, open licenses, open source and open reporting.

As a Shuttleworth Fellow, you will be creating intellectual property by writing, gathering data, contributing to designs and so on. The intellectual property you create will belong to you (or your organisation if you so choose) to ensure you have the power to continue to use, share and evolve it. To help you get your ideas out into the world, and realise the potential value of openness, you will release everything as an open resource. Resources are open when they are available for revision, translation, improvement and sharing, under open licenses, open standards and in open formats, free from technical protection measures.

We understand that there are a number of legitimate reasons why certain resources may not be made open. We will consider instances of privacy, confidentiality, security and utility which may preclude certain documents or information from being licensed in this way, but our default is always open.

Grant You will receive a grant, in four equal instalments, to devote your time and energy to your Fellowship. You will be responsible for managing your own time and efforts, and complying with the relevant tax laws in your jurisdiction.

Alongside this grant, in a separate process, you will have the opportunity to apply for additional project funding by making a personal contribution. We will match your contribution of up to 25,000 USD tenfold, with project funding of 250,000 USD. This funding may be used by you to advance your thinking, collaborate, travel, create or drive your ideas forward and will be governed by separate agreements.

There are many legal forms an initiative can take to change the world. We wish for you to have the most appropriate structure to achieve your aims. We have no preference between non-profit, for-profit or no structure at all, it is about what works best for you. To continue to learn and evolve, and for the good of those that come after you, we would like to become a member of your decision-making board. If you have a for-profit entity, we ask for a 30% equity stake. Should you strike it big, you will be contributing to the support of future change agents.

Success Once you have joined this Fellowship, you will always be considered a Shuttleworth Fellow. You will be part of our community and will have a voice. We hope you will grow and learn with us, and your fellow Fellows, to build out a network of comrades that understand that the world should, and can, be better by being open.

Measuring your impact in the world will be hard. Whilst many models for measuring impact exist, in truth most of them only evaluate implementation, which is bound to be complex, will not adhere to your implementation timelines and will often extend way beyond your control. Instead, we think of success in terms of your on-going contribution to change.

For us, the highest level of success at the end of a fellowship year is that we know more than we did at the beginning, and that that knowledge has allowed you, us and others to shift thinking. This can only happen through experimentation and iteration, and when that knowledge is available to others to learn from and build upon. In the long term, we hope that you go on to influence positive social change in your field way beyond the duration of this year.

We want you to know, it is our belief that the more you put in, the more you share, the more open you are, the more successful you will become. Within this context, we work with you to define your own successes, for the fellowship year and for your big picture change in the world.

Thank you You are dedicating your valuable time and efforts to building something bigger than yourself, whilst placing your faith in a Foundation you don’t yet know well. You have been brave enough to re-imagine how our world can be more safe, more equitable and more just. We owe you our gratitude for your unique vision, your passion and your desire to make the changes you have so eloquently expressed to us.

Thank you for joining us. We hope you are as excited as we are.

## iii. Open requirements

The Open Requirements are an addendum to the fellowship agreement letter, ensuring every fellow is committed to openness in every aspect of their work, wherever possible.

### Open requirements

Being open about our work is vital for others to replicate them and benefit society. If we can shorten the time it takes a good idea to spread by living out loud, the results will speak for themselves. Everything we work on - from education to science to telecoms - demonstrates the power of openness, participation and creativity. We believe your work can help us build an open knowledge society. That is why we insist on open communications, open licenses, open source and open reporting.

To help Fellows get their ideas out into the world, and realise the value of openness at the core of our theory of change, so Fellows and the people we support to work with Fellows release everything they make as an open resource. Resources are open resources when they are publicly available online for revision, translation, improvement and sharing under open licenses, open standards and in open formats, free of technical protection measures.

### Knowledge Resources

If you are a Fellow, then the Open Requirements apply to knowledge resources that you create during the Fellowship year or pay for as a fellow. If compelling reasons of privacy, confidentiality or security make it inappropriate for you to make a particular document or information open, then you can discuss those issues with us. Every decision to exempt a particular resource from the Open Requirements and the justification for the exemption is recorded. Fear of unforeseeable consequences or of the negative reactions of others or the desire to use patents to raise capital are not compelling reasons to depart from the Open Requirements.

### Open Content and Data

You must make knowledge resources open as defined in the Open Definition (http://opendefinition.org/) “A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.” You must share data (http://opendefinition.org/licenses/\#Data) under Creative Commons 0 or another license or dedication that complies with the Open Definition (http://opendefinition.org/). You must share knowledge resources using a format that is platform independent, machine readable, editable and available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of the information.

### Free and Open Source Software

You must distribute software under the General Public License 3.0 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl) or another license listed by the Open Source Initiative as complying with the Open Source Definition (http://opensource.org/osd) but you must license software that functions primarily as network server software under the GNU Affero General Public License (www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

### Open Hardware

You must license all hardware under a license or licenses that comply with the Open Source Hardware Definition (http://www.oshwa.org/definition/). If semiconductor chip products or mask rights apply to anything you create during the Fellowship year or pay for as Fellow, you must give an irrevocable non-exclusive royalty free license or licenses under those rights that permits enables anyone to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import or distribute products conditional only upon attribution and share-alike requirements.

### Other Licenses

You can share data and knowledge resources subject to Intellectual Property under licenses that are more restrictive than those required here but only if you share the same data or knowledge resource under the open licenses or dedications required here. You can also ask the Foundation to agree that you can use to a more restrictive license without the simultaneous distribution required here.

### Patents and Registered Designs

You are free to ask the Foundation to agree that you obtain a patent, utility patent, registered designs, plant breeder’s right or similar registered right over any knowledge resource or Intellectual Property under the Open Requirements but you must not do so without written agreement. If you do so without written agreement then the Foundation can require you to transfer the registered right to the Foundation.

### Ownership

Intellectual Property over knowledge resources that you create during a Fellowship year or pay for as Fellow belongs to you, unless you’ve agreed with the Foundation that the Intellectual Property is owned by an Intellectual Property Steward. You in the Open Requirements means you as a Fellow. In any Fellowship year You can transfer ownership of any of the Intellectual Property under the Open Requirements but only with the written agreement of the Foundation.

When you as Fellow pay someone else to create anything under Intellectual Property with funds from the Foundation you must ensure that the Intellectual Property is owned by you or in the Intellectual Property Steward if someone else is Intellectual Property Steward. Ownership of Intellectual Property under the Open Requirements is good and sufficient consideration for you to comply with the Open Requirements.

In the Open Requirements ‘Intellectual Property’ means patents, rights to inventions, registered designs, semi-conductor product and mask rights, design rights, know-how, trade secrets, trade marks, Uniform Resource Locators (URL), all rights of copyright, neighboring rights, database rights and all rights having equivalent or similar effect anywhere in the world.

To make sure that others can carry on the work you have started the Foundation has as a perpetual, universal, royalty free license to all Intellectual Property under the Open Requirements which entitles the Foundation to distribute the Intellectual Property on any terms which it deems fit including under one or more public licenses or to grant non-exclusive all rights reserved licenses to others including through multiple tiers of sub-licenses, without any further obligation to you.

### Stewardship

In these Open Requirements you also means anyone who has agreed to be Intellectual Property Steward for knowledge resources of a Fellow. The Open Requirements apply to Intellectual Property over knowledge resources created by a Fellow during a Fellowship year or paid for as Fellow. You have the same obligations as a Fellow under the Open Requirements.

## iv. Open Locks

Open Locks are a very specific legal mechanism to make sure that initial commitments to keep various things in the open remain so. Below, we discuss how the Shuttleworth Foundation has been using Open Locks, and we give specific examples that may be useful to others.

### Open Locks: Legal commitments that lock in trust

It’s hard for anyone to make a positive change in the world when they are behind on mortgage payments, have credit card debt building up, and are waiting for a decision on a grant. And things get even testier when a private investor waves a few high-number bills under their nose and offers to buy them out – on the proviso they make a few “concessions,” of course.

The history of open knowledge resource organisations – from open software through open textbooks to open science through open hardware – is littered with this kind of occurrence. Some founders start out with the best intentions before defecting to the comforts and potential riches of a proprietary model. Many others find themselves pressured by investors – or even board members – to lock up knowledge and charge for it instead. But most just run out of steam due to life getting in the way – and seek what is a the only way out to make it easier.

Such experience goes against what many founders start out trying to achieve. They fund something to be open, only to turn around after the acquittals have been sent to find the project has now sold its IP to someone else.

This raises an important question: How do we ensure that the founder’s commitment to openness and society endures when circumstances change? The Shuttleworth Foundation solution is the Open Lock.

The Open Lock is a binding legal commitment with explicit wording inserted or added into the foundational documents of a social enterprise, nonprofit or for-profit. It is an important innovation for the Foundation – and the wider open world – and is an entrenched provision in the governing documents of a company that requires open licensing.

The impact of the Open Lock is simple but incredibly effective: it means no one who acts for a company has the legal authority to lock down knowledge. It acts as a last line of defence against the threat of proprietary interests now and in the future, and ensures the original commitment to social change remains in place, regardless of what decisions or circumstances occur with the founder.

An Open Lock can be used in a multitude of different ways. It might be used to ensure an organisation cannot apply for patents, or it could be used to prevent a volunteer data being sold off to the higher bidder.

An Open Lock is a binding commitment in the foundational documents of an enterprise to share knowledge under open licenses. Sometimes it includes a commitment not to close knowledge in a certain way. For example, an Open Lock could state that an enterprise will not apply for software patents.

For-profit enterprises and many nonprofits are incorporated: that is, they are legal entities recognised under law, and defined by their foundational documentation. Open Locks can be written into those foundational documents when the organisation becomes incorporated, or existing companies can add them by amending their foundational documents. An organisation that is not incorporated can include an Open Lock in a constitution.

The legal effect of an Open Lock is that no-one who acts for a company has the legal authority to lock knowledge down.

As with similar provisions, an Open Lock can usually be changed, but change can only happen through a special procedure. For instance, changing an Open Lock usually requires the agreement of an external guarantor, who may only hold a few shares but can veto any change to the Open Lock. The guarantor is often referred to as holding a golden share. The difficulty of changing an Open Lock means that it can’t be done quickly or easily or surreptitiously. Instead, there is time for social processes to play out, for contributors to withdraw their work, for someone to fork the project, and for those who’ve helped build it to be heard.

At the Foundation we created Open Locks to add to our toolkit because we needed them to help our Fellows build new enterprises on a foundation of openness. For instance, Content Mine is a scientific data-mining non-profit that uses an Open Lock to guarantee that its data and software will remain open. And Siyavula is a textbook publisher committed to licensing all volunteer contributions under a Creative Commons Attribution license.

While our Open Locks have already helped to protect commitments to open knowledge, we’ve only been using them for a few years. They are an experiment that will only be truly tested over the long term. There is much to learn. We are looking forward to seeing how other social enterprises do better than we have done, and extend the experiment in ways that we haven’t thought about.

Exactly how an Open Lock is implemented depends on applicable company law, what the company does, and the likely threats to its mission. As a starting place, we’ve developed example clauses that we and others can use, adapt and improve.

We use this model legal language as an Open Lock in agreements and foundational documents. Our latest language is in our Github repository.

## v. Gathering Guidelines

Below, we include practical how-tos of our Gathering format to demonstrate how to balance power dynamics and create constructive collaborative events.

### Gathering Rules

There are a few rules necessary to orchestrate the Gathering, but they all revolve around respecting the process which in turn, respects the people.

**1. If you come at all, you come for it all**  
Current fellows MUST attend and all attendees must be present for the entire period. There is a designed sense of egalitarianism at every Gathering. Everyone is at the same level, there for the entirety, and no one is special.

**2. Be present**  
All sessions are important, nothing is skippable. No time out to take calls or hold offsite meetings – it breaks the dynamic. To create a productive community of trust and respect, everyone must be “all in.”

**3. No presentations**  
Monologues and powerpoint presentations are unwelcome. Breakout sessions are held to create dialogue around a specific issue so the host gets as much wisdom from as many people in the room as possible. These are for honest deep dives into issues, not to present your best possible self; you are not selling yourself or your project. Keep. It. Real.

**4. No companions**  
Gatherings are for fellows and staff only and family or team members should not attend events or share accommodation. The focus is on generating a community. Others are a distraction, diminishing this effort substantially.

**5. Meeting rules**  
In addition to the Gathering rules which relate to the event as a whole, these are the rules that the facilitator shares at the beginning of each Gathering to remind the group how to work together during the event.

The rules:

* Treat others with respect at all times.
* Be on time. If you aren’t on time, you will sing a song. No exceptions.
* Listen and focus.
* When we disagree, agree to diversity of opinion rather than debate.
* No jargon.
* Questions are heroic acts.
* With N people in the room, speak 1/Nth of the time.
* Practice constructive selfishness: working through problems or opportunities that are important to you in ways that have benefit for other participants.
* During breaks, sit with someone you don’t know well.
* Don’t share beyond the group without permission.
* Devices at ease. Keep laptops and phones out of sight and out of mind. Technology is distracting and will negatively affect the ability to engage.

### The Agenda

Key features:

* The number of people in each session is small.
* Ample breaks throughout the day to avoid exhaustion.
* Lots of space for impromptu conversations and breakouts.
* Not set in stone: Be prepared to adjust the agenda through the week as needed.
* A variety of session types.

### Typical Sessions

* “Dogfood” sessions: Fellows present some aspect of their current work where they invite colleagues to try something out, advise on a tricky situation, discuss a potential strategy pivot.
* Breakouts: Sessions centred around particular topics which have been curated to take advantage of the mix of fellows and requests. Tools, technical project needs, how to do remote better, personal sustainability…
* Skills shares: Everyone gets a sheet of paper where they can (if they want) list a skill they could share. The skills are sometimes relevant to being a fellow, such as “how to write an email that will get results,” and some are not – such as how to do a tap dance move called “shave and a haircut.” Fellows not sharing can choose a skill to learn.
* Letter writing: Every staff member and fellow gets an envelope and a piece of paper. They have 30 minutes to then find a space and write a letter to themselves. In that letter they write about their feelings right now and what they want to tell themselves six months from now. Some keep the entire archive of letters they’ve written in the sealed envelope and look back over it each year.
* Sage session: Experts from very different contexts, invited not as participants but as instructors, lead optional sessions on topics ranging from fundraising, marketing, to HR, or public speaking.

### Facilitation Tips

Great facilitation lies at the heart of a successful Gathering, and over the years we have gained valuable insight into getting the mix just right. It’s important for the facilitator to come from outside the organisation, to remove the hierarchies sometimes imposed by the everyday workings of the fellowship. We must all surrender control to the facilitator so they – alone – can apply the Gathering rules to all participants equally and fairly.

If the facilitator were part of the group, the dynamic would already be a bust. It’s a subtle point. While some would suggest these issues can be easily resolved by simply playing by the rules, in practice it’s very different. Any kind of existing hierarchical relationship between the facilitator and group members will, inevitably, skew the dynamic for the worse.

The facilitator holds the room to the rules we’ve agreed to, and oversees each Gathering with an iron fist in a velvet glove. Promptness is a perfect example. It matters. It is expected of everyone as a matter of respect. And if you’re late, you will sing a song – with no exceptions. It is a matter of embarrassment for some – and rather unwarranted pride for others – but there is a shared expectation that you will be penalised for disrupting the flow and disrespecting the group.

Correcting those minor infractions with moments of joy in an intense five-day event is one of the many ways a facilitator must mediate the interpersonal and group dynamics. It takes a skilled and steady hand to navigate everyone through a Gathering without conflict. Even the closest of families fight when they’re in a room for five days, and our fellowship is no exception. Too lax, and arguments and bad feeling can slip into the fray; too stern, and it could lead to a multitude of unproductive wormholes.

We have learned that working with one person who understands us and what we are trying to achieve, rather than relearning norms each time, is much more rewarding.

## vi. Thou shalt scale sustainably

Crowdsourced in Vancouver, Canada, from the assembled Shuttleworth fellows, alumni and staff of 2017, and transcribed (with bad jokes) by Gavin Weale.

### The Ten Commandments of Scaling

In the world of social innovation and making change, we are continually barraged by the imperative to scale. In every funding bid, in every set of objectives, it is an impossible dynamic to escape if you are trying to seek support. But what does scale even mean? And why do you even want to scale? More importantly, if you do end up going 100X, will you know how to handle it without turning into a hot mess of anxiety and remorse?

Following a Come-to-Jesus confessional about my scaling pains with Livity Africa, in which I described an attempt to scale in 2016 that ended in tears, heartbreak and debt, we discussed and shortlisted the top ten lessons I and others should draw from the combined hivemind-megabrain of the Shuttleworth Foundation macro-institutional memory.

That is to say: here is the shit you might benefit from knowing, in ten Biblical directives. In short: you can believe in God, but do remember to tie up your camels.

**1. Cashflow is king**  
Whatever your P&L or balance sheet says, if you see minus signs in your cashflow then you have to take action, and quickly. This may mean painful decisions like reducing headcount. You need to grasp those nettles as early as you can to avoid greater pain down the road when you can’t afford to pay people’s salaries. Which, for those who have never experienced it, creates a sensation something akin to what I imagine having a fork inserted into one of your eyeballs would feel like.

**2. Thou shalt be true to thine mission**  
Success can breed success, and, especially in the funding world, zeitgeists come and go. You may be the cock of the walk today, but if the whims of funders change, you could be tomorrow’s Kentucky Fried Leftovers. When scaling fast, you can protect yourself by defining and adhering to your mission with almost laser precision. If you and your team are clear on the value want to create, you are less likely to sleepwalk into bad funding relationships.

**3. Blessed be the incrementalist**  
There are hares. There are tortoises. And there are lemmings waiting to throw themselves off of the Cliff of Scale through sheer stupidity. If I could talk with my younger self, the one with a full head of hair and a six-pack, I would tell him to approach big opportunities with an attitude of incrementalism, both in terms of the targets he takes on, and the team he builds. And I would tell him to stop being such a dick.

**4. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s scale**  
Your growth and your scale is your own business. While it may be tempting to think that the Silicon Valley model of scale is the only true benchmark, in the context of a social enterprise, the scale is relative to your impact. If you train a million people, is that truly “scale” if the training is not impact? What even is scale? Why is it important to you? How do you define it? What’s the meaning of life? Who am I? What year is it? Who’s the President? (Actually, on second thoughts, don’t answer that last one…)

**5. Thou shalt not take whopper-bucks**  
Who is going to say no to being offered a squillion dollars by a funder? But if you do… what happens when that contract ends? Large funding wins should greeted with celebratory fizzy drinks or other non-alcoholic victuals, and then treated with extreme caution and scepticism. Your approach to scaling up will be key here. How will you crew up and then potentially crew down if the contract is relatively short? Whopper money with a whopper target tastes better on the way down when the funds hit your account, but not so good when you are vomiting blood with anxiety trying to hit an astronomical delivery target. Make sure your funder-target is achievable and delivers scale of impact too.

**6. Thou shalt be modular**  
If you are to stray from your mission in the interests of, say, generating a ton of cash from a commercial opportunity, then you should try and think modular. That could mean sectioning off products or revenue streams to be delivered in a way that they can be grown/spun-off, or killed and forgotten without spilling too much blood. Never look a gift-horse in the mouth. Just make sure you can humanely shoot it in the paddock if it leads you in the wrong direction.

**7. Thou shalt document**  
Sustainable growth will only happen through continuous learning. Documenting mistakes and learnings, as well as recording values, mission and strategic/operational principles, is best captured along the way – although some of the most critical learnings will inevitably be internalised by the sheer agony they cause you. In a way, defining your scale in terms of your business model could be treated as a product or experiment of its own.

**8. Thou shalt have stretchy pants**  
Cashflow will fluctuate, especially if your model is heavily funder-based. How are you going to keep your voluminous under-trousers stretchy enough to take up the slack when your coffers grow, but not fall to your ankles when your pockets are empty, leaving you dangerously exposed? It is worth having scenarios in mind for both worst and best case scenarios, and considering how your operations and team would cope with either. This will force you to think about the best way to scale up or down in an agile way. An outsourced/freelancer model may help.

**9. Thou shalt put time and effort into your financial forecasting**  
If you do not understand your numbers you will die. Make sure you know, or pay for someone who knows how to help you know. Reading a cashflow forecast and profit and loss sheet is a basic human need for a social entrepreneur. Cigarette-packet budgets and thumbsuck forecasts will get you through a couple of years of helter-skelter growth, but if you want to really ride the Big Wheel, you better invest in the time or cost of a bad-ass bean counter. And if that is not a clusterfuck of metaphors in one sentence, I don’t know what is.

**10. Thou shalt define the value you want to create in the world**  
I will say it again: scaling numbers does not equal scaling impact. The value you want to create in the world is up to you to define, based on your ambition and the things you think are important in your theory of change. If you know you are creating true value and changing things, it should be fairly clear to you, and you perhaps should not even worry about scale if you haven’t got that bit clear. If you have, then go forth: you are ready to make like a lizard and get scaley.
