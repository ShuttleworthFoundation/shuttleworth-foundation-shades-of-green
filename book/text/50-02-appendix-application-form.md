## **i** Application form

Every potential fellow fills out an application form. Each question is designed to help everyone understand the essence of what, why and how a change will manifest.

Prospective applicants often ask us to narrow down the parameters for applications and be more specific about what we’re looking for. We are not planning on doing that, as we want to be surprised and intrigued by applicants, no matter how unconventional the idea may be.

Deliberately, the form uses clean, simple questions that carve a narrative and act as a basis for conversation and partnership.
