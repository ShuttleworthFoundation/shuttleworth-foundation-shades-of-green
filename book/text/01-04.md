# 04 With people

Individuals carry their knowledge and experience with them throughout their lives. The Foundation looks for people who will experiment and learn as they follow their passion to solve a specific problem. Our investment continues to effect positive change far beyond the life of any specific grant.

Projects and organisations come and go. Many ideas do not result in successful outcomes on the first try. This is why we fund people, not projects.

Certain individuals are willing to take a risk for the greater good; they remain tenacious, and as long as we believe in them, and they have the strength to get up and try again, we are confident they will eventually turn their dream into reality.
