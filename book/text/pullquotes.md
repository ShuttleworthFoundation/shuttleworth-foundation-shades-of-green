“It is 7.30 on a Sunday morning and I am sitting in a hotel in Nairobi already deep into commercial analysis of minerals contracts the Somali government may or may not sign with a bunch of multinationals.  I wouldn’t be sitting here if it wasn’t for the Shuttleworth Foundation. We are directly advising. These deals are so potentially huge that if we can up a government stake by 3% they may get another $50 million… I’m here because of Open - we built a profile in an incredibly conservative world because we have published models … And because we use an open standard, with a community behind it, everywhere we go we’re like a slug leaving a trail…”

“Many fellowships end when [funding] ends – that’s it. You don’t go to meetings and you aren’t invited – you become part of the mailing list and it ends there.

“There is no other funding community that I have stayed in touch with – by any comparison. The Gatherings are such an important space to refresh myself professionally.”

“The fellowship has totally changed my life – and it’s still one of the biggest things in my life. It’s my heartbeat, a guiding light, and gives me an environment that fuels me and I can pay back into. The Gatherings are so important to do this.”

Peter Murray Rust (2014-2016)
