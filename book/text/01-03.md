## **03** In practice

The Foundation is, at its core, an experiment in open philanthropy, exploring alternative funding methodologies and collaborative ways of working. We look for social innovators who help to change the world for the better and can benefit from this model.

We identify amazing people and give them a fellowship. Funding is awarded in two parts â€“ a fellowship grant and project funding. The grant establishes personal sustainability for the fellow by covering their salary for a year, freeing them up to implement their idea full-time. The amount is contracted up front. This helps create an environment in which the fellow is able to experiment from a position of personal security and freedom.

The project funding is an equal amount per fellow per year. Project funding is not contracted up front but is instead unlocked throughout the year as needed.

Fellowship funding lasts a year and is renewable for up to three years. Beyond the funding period, fellows stay fellows forever.
